## Current Issues to Fix

### High Priority Bugs (Prio 1)

### Medium Priority Bugs (Prio 5)

- if no gui defined - the esp server shows per default an empty gui page. -> in this case set live button as unvisible and sow the settingspage instead.

### Low Priority Bugs/Features

- **[FEATURE] Automated component testing** (Prio 10)

  - Create script that checks component on/off flags
  - Ensure compilation succeeds for all flag combinations
  - Integrate into test engine for comprehensive validation

- **[FEATURE] add HTTPS support, because its not in core ESP32 WiFi lib yet.** (Prio: not yet, wait for updates)

- **[FEATURE] if there are more cards, the card brocken down is under the longest card from above. It looks not fine -> remake the grid to be more flexible (Prio 10)**
